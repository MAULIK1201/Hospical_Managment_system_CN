## üöë Project Overview

The network is divided into distinct sections, each assigned a unique network IP to facilitate structured communication. The hospital sections include:

- **Head Office**
- **Control Room**
- **Basement**
- **Floor 0**
- **Floor 1**
- **Floor 2**
- **Floor 3**

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Protocols:
- **TCP/IP Protocol**: Ensures reliable data transfer across the network.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: Simplifies routing table updates within the network.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Optimizes routing paths for efficient communication.

### Devices Used:
- **Computers**: For administrative and operational tasks.
- **Switches** and **Routers**: Facilitate wired communication between devices.
- **Access Points**: Enable wireless communication within the hospital.
- **Printers**: For document and report generation.
- **DNS Server**: Provides domain name resolution.
- **Email Server**: Handles internal and external communication.
- **DHCP Server**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
- **Web Server**: Hosts the hospital's internal website.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

- Network segmentation ensures each section operates independently while communicating seamlessly with others.
- RIP and OSPF protocols enhance routing efficiency across the hospital's network.
- Integration of both wired and wireless communication ensures flexibility and reliability.
